# A shopping application developped with reactjs, redux-thunk, axios and antd

This project was developed with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

That is a another version of this example but developped with redux-saga. See more info ()

## 1. Setting up. 项目开始。

Clone this repo and adjust details in `package.json`. Remove the `.git` directory and `git init` to start fresh.

克隆这个仓库，调整适合自己项目的`package.json`，移除`.git`文件并使用`git init`来初始化。

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoloistWang/reactjs-redux-antd.git
```

## 2. Config package.json. 包配置。
- [`antd`] Hash passwords. 加密密码。
- [`axios`] An implementation of JSON Web Tokens. 实现JSON Web令牌。
- [`babel-plugin-import`] Authenticate HTTP requests. 验证HTTP请求。
- [`connected-react-router`]  Declarative routing. 声明路由。
- [`customize-cra`] Putting a soft cushion between you all the cool new file formats being developed for node.js such as CoffeeScript, SASS, and Jade. 提供一个环境，任何 JavaScript 代码都可以向下编译成可以在今天随处可用的版本。
- [`less`] Parse request bodies. 解析请求主体。
- [`react-app-rewired`] Code formatting. 代码格式化。
- [`redux`] Enable cross-domain requests. 配置跨域请求。
- [`react-router`] Auto-restart when your files change. 文件改动时自动重启进程。

run `npm install` to install the dependencies
运行 `npm install` 来加载依赖包

```bash
npm install
```

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
